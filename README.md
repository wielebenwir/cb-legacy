A Wordpress plugin for management and booking of commons goods. 


## Description 

This plugin gives associations, groups and individuals the ability to share items (e.g. cargobikes, tools) with users. It is based on the idea of Commons and sharing resources for the benefit of the community. 

It was developed for the ["commons cargo bike" movement](http://www.wielebenwir.de/mobilitaet/free-nomadic-cargo-bikes-are-changing-the-urban-landscape) across Germany and Austria, but it can use it for any kind items.

**Unique features:**

* Items, locations and timeframes: No need for a "centralised storage", items can be assigned to different locations for the duration of a timeframe, each with their own contact information.  
* Simple booking process: A booking is at least one full day, just pick the date on the calendar.
* Auto-accept bookings: A registered user can book items without the need for administration. 
* Codes: The plugin automatically generates booking codes, which are used at the station to validate the booking. 
* Users can leave booking comments (e.g. what they use the item for).


**Use cases:**

* You/your associations owns special tools that are not in use every day, and you want to make them available to a local group.
*  You own a cargo bike that you want to share with the community, and it will be placed at different locations throughout the year.

### 0.9.4

Markus Voge took over adding features to Version 1.0.

* FEATURE: Locations can receive copies of confirmation emails that concern
  their item. This feature must be enabled for each location by checking the new
  checkbox "Send copies of booking confirmation emails to the location" on the
  location edit page. By default, the checkbox is unchecked. If it is checked,
  any email address entered into the contact details text field will receive
  copies of all conformation emails, but only about the item managed by the
  location.
* FEATURE: Emails are sent to users confirming the cancelation of a booking.
  The concerned location is informed via a copy of the email if the "Send
  copies ..." checkbox is checked (see above).
* FEATURE: When an admin deletes an open booking from the bookings table, the
  user (and location if configured, see above) is also informed via email.
* FEATURE: When the location of an item changes, users who already booked are
  informed via email of the new location. If configured for receiving email
  copies (see above), also the old and new location are informed. Admins can
  either edit an existing timeframe to change the location or delete the old and
  create a new timeframe at the correct location. This enables to use a "fake"
  location as a placeholder and then change to the actual location as soon as it
  is known.
* FIXED: Bookings table shows the latest bookings at the top by default (default
  order: descending by booking start date).

### 0.9.4.2
